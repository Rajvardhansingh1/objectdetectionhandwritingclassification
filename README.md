Well welcome to this github repo of handwriting detection and object recognition. 
Now what you need to know is that like every code base this too has a front end and backend
As you can read the frontend is all in a folder and the backend is weel just everywhere except in the frontend folder
the main file that you need to look for is model.py which has all the backend code ( Smart me to keep all the code together)
Now just run model.py on fastAPI or postman or maybe run the front end code.
to run the frontend which isnt very impressive to be honest but yeah, to run the frontend just donwload flutter and then you can run it from there
just make sure you have, all the necessary libraries mentioned in model.py to run this code and you have flutter compattible.
Happy tunning the code, best of luck and goodbye
